+”David” is a marble statue carved by Italian artist Michelangelo which depicts the biblical figure David. It was commissioned for the construction of the Florence Cathedral, along with 11 other prophets. It was situated at the roofline of the cathedral, where it was then moved to the public square in front of the Palazzo della Signoria and finally moved to the Galleria dell’Accademia where it has remained since 1873. A replica of the statue is in its original spot in the public square.+
