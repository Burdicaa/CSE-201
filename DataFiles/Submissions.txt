+Warhol first exhibited these thirty-two canvases in 1962, displayed together on shelves like products in a grocery aisle. “I used to drink it,” he said of Campbell’s soup. “I used to have the same lunch every day, for 20 years, I guess, the same thing over and over again.” Though the paintings resemble the mass-produced, printed advertisements that inspired Warhol, they are hand-painted, and the fleur-de-lys pattern ringing each can’s bottom edge is handstamped. Mimicking the repetition and uniformity of advertising by carefully reproducing the same image across each individual canvas, he varied only the label on the front of each can.+

+”David” is a marble statue carved by Italian artist Michelangelo which depicts the biblical figure David. It was commissioned for the construction of the Florence Cathedral, along with 11 other prophets. It was situated at the roofline of the cathedral, where it was then moved to the public square in front of the Palazzo della Signoria and finally moved to the Galleria dell’Accademia where it has remained since 1873. A replica of the statue is in its original spot in the public square.+
